AI Project -- 8_Puzzle Problem

Input is a file called 'Puzzle.txt'

Output File is Called '8_Puzzle_Output.txt'



Algorithm For 8_Puzzle ==>>
	Solve the puzzle with hamming distance

1)  Read the puzzle from file
2)  make sure that the puzzle is solvable if not print can't solve
3)  make the state of puzzle visited
4)  Get the neighbours of the zero and make sure that when change to this nieghbour is not visited
5)  Get hamming distance
6)  sort the solutions and Get the least Solution
7)  if found the goal print the path of the solution in file else print can't find solution
